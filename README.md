# BrailleVision
A real-time handheld scanner that can 1) convert depth information into vibrating haptic feedback to the user's hand, 2) send audio telling the user what object is in front of them, and 3) send audio data for text-to-speech from the surrounding scene. This will aid the blind and visually impaired to navigate the world with ease.
